python wrapper over dmap library for python visualization.
This wrapper uses the following RST libraries:
  "rtime","dmap", "rcnv"

This setup.py assumes rst libraries are located in /usr/local/lib64/  

::Install instructions::
1) edit setup.py to make sure the rst libraries are in the library path.

2) Now run the build command
python setup.py --build

3) This will create temporary build directories under build subdirectory.
For example on Fedora 16 the python module is built here:
build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/pydmap.so

Copy the pydmap.so file into this top level directory.

::Test instructions::

edit __init__.py to point to an example dmap based file.

run python __init__.py
This will run through a "slow" test read of all the records of the dmap file by both ways supported.

::Further Information::
This dmap wrapper exposes two ways to access dmap record information, using python's concept of a dictionary. 

One way lets you specify a variable name as a key which will result in a time keyed dictionary for just that variable. 

The second way lets you key a time key to access all the variables for a single time record in the dmap.

The time keys can either be specified as datetime objects or as matplotlib style "fractional days" since Jan 1 1970.
